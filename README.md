# Cookie Clicker

### by Gemi, Sanjay and Sarah

We made a cookie clicker gamer with recently learned notions of JS.
We spent 6 days on it and used Discord as our main means of communication on WFH days.

We used a few tools to keep our project organized :
* Trello: our table can be found [here](https://trello.com/b/qC5yi2fq/cookie-clicker)
* Figma: we made a [model](https://trello.com/c/aEyKC4zY/5-maquette) of the final product 
* Discord

Our front-end part includes notions from Bootstrap as well. 

Our final code can be found [here](https://github.com/sabbels/cookieclicker) and the product can be visualized [here][]
